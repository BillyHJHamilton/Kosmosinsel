/*
Command format:
(command) (subject) (target)

Subject:
The subject of a command is normally or more units, separated by commas: 100,110
When firing or attacking, the subject is the attacking unit(s).
A number may be followed by "+" to indicate an advantage: 100,110+,120
When firing, this "+" indicates enfilading fire.
When attacking, this "+" indicates a flanking attack.

Commands:
near		fire at near range
far		    fire at far range
attack		run a close combat and apply all results
form		change formation
stat		report status
test		test morale and become disrupted on failure

Target:
near, far   A single unit to fire on.
            Special: In sphere formation, multiple targets may be given.
attack      The defending unit or units.  May use + to indicate defender flanks attacker.
form        The name of the formation: line, column, sphere, skirmish, or rout.
stat, test  (No target)

Examples of valid commands:
100 near 200
100,110 far 200
100,110,120+ attack 200,210
100 attack 200,210+,220+
100 form line
100,110 stat
120 test

Commands with no subject:
undo

Possible commands to add:
launch      deploy fighters
recall      recall fighters
swarm       attack with fighters
turn        end turn, try to rally units
assign      set which player controls units
attach      attach commander to a unit (and detach from any other unit)
 - attached commander risks being hit, but provides combat advantage

Not sure what numbers to use for fighters - Could use a convention like add 1, or add f or something.
